            <p>I have recently completed my bachalors degree at the University of 
                Arizona for computer science. These past few years have taught me 
                much about myself; what I can do and what I can handle. The classes 
                I have taken from Automata to Operating Systems have been some of the
                 most challenging experiences of my life and my education this far. </p>

            <p>Looking back, I am proud to have choosen the challenge of computer science 
                and its many aspects. The road has not been easy, I have spent many 
                sleepless nights working on solving problems by finding unique and
                 efficient solutions to them. That is truely why I love computer science 
                 and programming, the stange and tantalizing experience of working through
                  and solving problems. There is no better experience then having your code
                   compile and having it pass all your test cases. It is a feeling of self worth and
                   accomplishment.</p>

            <p>During my time at the University of Arizona I have become proficient and written 
                in many programming languages such as Python, Java, C, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, R
                 and others. More importantly this degree has taught me the fundamental way of 
                 thinking need to be successful in computer science. I have learned core ideas 
                 and design patterns. Communcation is also a very critical factor when working on a team.
                Looking to the future I am motivated and excited to continue to learn more and </p>
