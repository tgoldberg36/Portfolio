            <p>I have recently completed my bachalors degree at the University of 
                Arizona in computer science. These past few years have taught me 
                much about myself; what I can do and what I can handle. The classes 
                I have taken from Automata to Operating Systems have been some of the
                 most challenging experiences of my life and my education this far. </p>

            <p>Looking back, I am proud to have choosen the challenge of computer science 
                and its many aspects. The road has not been easy, I have spent many 
                sleepless nights working on solving problems by finding unique and
                 efficient solutions to them. That is truely why I love computer science 
                 and programming, the stange and tantalizing experience of working through
                  and solving problems. There is no better feeling then having your code
                   compile and having it pass all your test cases. It is a feeling of self worth and
                   accomplishment.</p>

            <p>During my time at the University of Arizona I have become proficient and written 
                in many programming languages such as Python, Java, C, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, R
                 and others. More importantly this degree has taught me the fundamental way of 
                 thinking needed to be successful in computer science. I am able to effficently 
                 use online resources to learn more about specific topics and task I want to accomplish through code. I have learned  the core ideas 
                 and design patterns that computer science follows. My minor in ISTA(information techonology and the arts) has 
                 taught me design princples through classes like human computer interaction that improve the user experience of my applicaitons.
                 Communcation is also a very critical factor when working on a team, it important to continuously review requirements given by the stakeholder and update them when needed.
                 I have worked on mulitple projects including a designing and building a website for college of education at the UofA for the purpose of online graduation ceremonies. I am
                looking forward to the future and whatever it brings. I am motivated and excited to continue to learn more about software engineering which I believe will become even more 
                necessary for everyday life. </p>
