            <p>I am Taylor Goldberg, a recent graduate from the University of Arizona. I completed my bachelors degree in computer science and have a minor in ISTA(Information Technology and the Arts). The past few years have been challenging and I have learned persistence, resilience, and taking initiative. I have developed a broad set of skills, a knack for creativity and problem-solving, and innovation.</p>

            <p>My experience as a student software developer for the College of Education at the University of Arizona has taken me through a full software development lifecycle from start to finish. We followed the agile methodology where we gathered requirements, produced code, tested, and repeated continually involving the stakeholder in our development. During my time as a student developer, we created an official University of Arizona website for college of education students to log into and input photos, quotes, and other personal information for their Fall online graduation ceremony. We then created software that automatically generated slides for individual students that were shown at the ceremony using googleâ€™s slide API. This project has taught me the fundamentals of software development. </p>

            <p> Software engineering is my passion and I look to join an organization where I can apply 
                my skills and collaborate on difficult challenges. In software engineering there is the sense of exhilaration and accomplishment you achieve when your code compiles and passes all your test cases. It is a feeling that I haven't felt in any other field or work in my 
                 life so far.  I want to join a dynamic organization that challenges the status quo, provides
                  better outcomes and truly makes a difference in the world. 
                  Concatenating my education and work experience, I have acquired proficiency in code reading, writing, and debugging. I have written code in over 10 languages and I am proficient in C, Java, Python, JS, and assembly. I have experience but not fully fluent in SQL and C++ and I am also currently learning the JavaScript framework React. My education has taught me problem solving, discipline, time management, collaboration and self-reliance. My work experience has taught me professional etiquette, skill application, communication, and adaptability. I have a strong foundation of skills but an even stronger desire to learn new languages and frameworks which will enable me to drive the innovation of the future. I am motivated and ready to take on new challenges. I look forward to hearing from you to discuss how I might apply my skills to better your company and my future team.  </p>
